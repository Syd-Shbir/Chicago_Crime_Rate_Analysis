# Predicting Crime Rates in Chicago

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent crime prediction model using Chicago's crime dataset. The analysis leverages advanced data science techniques to understand temporal and spatial crime trends, identify patterns in crime types and locations, and forecast future occurrences. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving public safety, optimizing resource allocation, and aiding urban planning.

## Key Features
- Analysis of crime trends over time (2012–2023), highlighting seasonal and annual variations.
- Identification of the most frequently committed crimes and their corresponding locations.
- Detection of crime hotspots and high-risk areas for specific crime types.
- Forecasting future crime occurrences using predictive modeling.
- Visualization of data trends through heatmaps, scatter plots, and temporal analyses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/crimes-2001-to-present), containing records of crimes reported in Chicago from 2001 to the present. Key features include:
- Case details (ID, description, location coordinates)
- Temporal information (date, time)
- Crime attributes (type, IUCR codes)
- Location information (district, community area, latitude/longitude)

## Methods and Tools
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering for effective analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and statistical analysis of trends and patterns.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Classification models (Naïve Bayes, Neural Networks)
  - Clustering models (K-Means)
  - Time series forecasting using FbProphet
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar graphs to depict trends and distributions.

## Results
The analysis provides:
1. Insights into the evolution of crime trends over time.
2. Identification of high-crime areas and most frequent crime types.
3. Predictions for future crime occurrences based on historical data.

## Installation
